# + password - Password for the database connection
public type ClientConfiguration record {
   string username;

};

# Represents the properties which are used to configure DB connection pool.
# Default values of the fields can be set through the configuration API.
#
# + connectionInitSql - SQL statement that will be executed after every new connection creation before adding it
#                       to the pool. Default value is none and it can be changed through the
#                       configuration API with the key `b7a.sql.pool.connectionInitSql`.
# + autoCommit - Auto-commit behavior of connections returned from the pool.
#                Default value is `true` and it can be changed through the configuration API with the key
#                `b7a.sql.pool.autoCommit`.
# + isXA - Whether connections are used for a distributed transaction. Default value is `false` and it
#          can be set through the configuration API with the key `b7a.sql.pool.isXA`.
# + maximumPoolSize - The maximum size that the pool is allowed to reach, including both idle and in-use connections.
#                     Default value is 15 and it can be changed through the configuration API with the key
#                     `b7a.sql.pool.maximumPoolSize`.
# + connectionTimeoutInMillis - The maximum number of milliseconds that a client will wait for a connection from the
#                       pool. Default value is 30000 (30 seconds) and it can be changed through the configuration API
#                       with the key `b7a.sql.pool.connectionTimeoutInMillis`. Lowest acceptable connection timeout
#                       value is 250 ms.
# + idleTimeoutInMillis - The maximum amount of time that a connection is allowed to sit idle in the pool. Default value
#                 is 600000 (10 minutes) and it can be changed through the configuration API with the key
#                 `b7a.sql.pool.idleTimeoutInMillis`. The minimum allowed value is 10000ms (10 seconds).
#                 This setting only applies when minimumIdle is defined to be less than maximumPoolSize.
# + minimumIdle - The minimum number of idle connections that pool tries to maintain in the pool. Default is the same as
#                 maximumPoolSize and it can be changed through the configuration API with the key
#                 `b7a.sql.pool.minimumIdle`.
# + maxLifetimeInMillis - The maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool. Default value is 1800000 (30 minutes)
#                  and it can be changed through the configuration API with the key `b7a.sql.pool.maxLifetimeInMillis`.
#                  A value of 0 indicates unlimited maximum lifetime (infinite lifetime), subject to
#                  the `idleTimeoutInMillis`.
# + validationTimeoutInMillis - The maximum duration of time that a connection will be tested for aliveness. Default
#                       value is 5000 (5 seconds) and it can be changed through the configuration API with the key
#                       `b7a.sql.pool.validationTimeoutInMillis`.  Lowest acceptable validation timeout is 250 ms.
