NAME
       ballerina-test - Run module tests

SYNOPSIS
       ballerina test [<options>] <module-name> [<config properties>]
       ballerina test -a | --all [<options>] [--] [<config properties>]
       ballerina test <balfile> [<config properties>]


DESCRIPTION
       Test compiles and executes Ballerina test sources and print a summary of
       test results. You can execute tests in a module,
       or an entire Ballerina project.
    
       Use 'ballerina test <module-name>' to execute tests in the
       specified module, or '-a' or '-all' to execute tests in all modules.

       Use 'ballerina test <balfile>' to execute the given Ballerina test file.
              Note that testing single bal files will not work within a Ballerina project.
              Also, imports from other modules will not work for file executions.
              File path can be relative or absolute.


OPTIONS
       --offline
           When building a module, the remote repository (Ballerina Central) is
           always checked for latest artifacts of the dependencies. If the
           '--offline' option is specified, this remote check is not done and
           the local artifacts will be used instead.

       --list-groups
           Lists the test groups available in the test files. Groups are
           tags that are added to test functions. They are used to
           control the execution of test functions by specifying a
           group or a set of groups that need to be executed in a test
           run. A test function can be grouped using the 'groups' parameter within the
           '@test:Config' annotation.

       --groups <test_group, ...>
           Specifies the test groups to be executed. Groups are tags that are
           added to test functions. They are used to control the
           execution of test functions by specifying a group or a set of
           groups that need to be executed in a test run. A test
           function can be grouped using the 'groups' parameter within the
           '@test:Config' annotation.

       --disable-groups <test_group, ...>
           Specifies the test groups to be excluded. Groups are tags that are
           added to test functions. They are used to control the
           execution of test functions by specifying a group or a set of
           groups that need to be executed in a test run. A test
           function can be grouped using the 'groups' parameter within the
           '@test:Config' annotation.

       --sourceroot <path>
           Location of the remote project root with source files. All
           executions will be relative to the path provided for
           sourceroot.

       --experimental
           Enable experimental language features.

       --skip-lock
           Build/Compile offline without downloading dependencies.

       --debug
           Start Ballerina in remote debugging mode.

CONFIG PROPERTIES
       (--key=value)...
           Set Ballerina environment parameters as key/value pairs.
           If multiple parameters need to be provided, each parameter
           has to be prefixed with '--'. Details of the environment parameters
           supported by the Ballerina standard library modules are specified
           in the relevant API documentation.


EXAMPLES
        Run all tests in the current project.
           $ ballerina test --all

        Run tests in math module.
           $ ballerina test math

        List all test groups in math module.
           $ ballerina test --list-groups math

        Run only the set of tests belonging to group_x in current project.
           $ ballerina test --groups group_x  --all

        Run tests in single bal file.
           $ ballerina test main_test.bal
